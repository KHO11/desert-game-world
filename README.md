# desert-game-world
A open game world set in a desert.

# Lessons learned
My first unity game project using unity game engine and C# with .Net Core framework.
Learnt how to code actions of a player and control what they do in an open world

# Potential future features
Adding more players in a desert and allowing your player to interact with people(NPC) and other players.
Extending the open game world, so potentially adding more cities that are not far from the desert.
